<h3> Description</h3> <br>

In this project i built an app that lets users learn about the missions and astronauts that formed NASA’s Apollo space program. Users will also learn when the mission was executed and which astronauts were the members of that mission and some more informations about those astronauts. 

Here i used Codable protocol, which is used for encode and decode data. I used identifiable protocol to identify every data of the member uniquely. More importantly i also worked with scroll views, navigation, and much more interesting layouts.

in this project i also practised with List, Text, and more, but i tried to solve an important SwiftUI problems that– 

 1. To make an image fit its space correctly.
 2. To clean up code using computed properties.
 3. Compose smaller views into larger ones to help keep our project organized.
